I think it is not difficult for a programmer who can achieve the following 32 points in a long term to eventually become a programming expert:
==

1. Excellent debugging ability, which is often more important than coding itself
2. Draw the class structure diagram and code sequence diagram before writing code , which will help you improve your coding skills quickly
3. Regularly refactoring code is really a good habit
4. The ability to write documents is very important. Just look at the documents of the most popular open source software such as Spring, hibernate, Struts, etc. , and you will know how easy to understand their tutorials, their getstarted, and their reference documents are.
5. Reinventing the wheel is a good way to learn coding, but don’t go crazy after you become proficient
6. Form your own variable naming rules, otherwise naming will take a lot of time
7. Algorithms are very important and you need to continue to study them in depth. In addition, many interviews at large companies will require you to write algorithms by hand.

Here I would like to share with you an algorithm notebook that has helped many people get offers from first-tier companies such as BAT. It was written by an Alibaba expert and is very useful for students who are weak in algorithms or need to improve. Algorithms must be the top priority in computer learning:
--
8. Do a good job of encapsulation, always keep in mind high cohesion and low coupling
9. Leave unreliable requirements to the last minute, as they may change by then.
10. Take warnings in your code seriously. They are not fatal, but they are a good opportunity to improve your code.
11. Unit testing is very important. It has at least the following benefits: convenient for later refactoring, optimized code design, documentation (unit testing itself is documentation), and regression (testing anytime, anywhere)
12. Learn to read open source code , and it’s best to run it and play with it. This will greatly improve your coding skills.
13. Learn to look at performance indicators and learn performance tuning. It is one of the best ways to differentiate programmers.
14. Remember to back up your data, otherwise you may end up in a bad situation.
15. Don’t doubt basic common sense, such as if the compiler fails to compile, suspect it’s a compiler problem
16. Learn to simulate the user environment, it will help you a lot at the critical moment
17. Don’t blindly use new technologies. You must first understand them thoroughly and learn about how others use them. Being the first to try something new is not always a good thing. You may also be choked by the crab’s legs.
18. Don’t underestimate the power of a good version control system. Just remember that git is the best, simple, reliable and free.19. Keep learning. The IT industry is changing with each passing day. Don’t be an outdated programmer.20. Use Google to your advantage21. When coding, only think about the logic of the same level of thinking. After completing this level, think about the next level. Only by breaking down the problem layer by layer can you solve it perfectly. Once you cross the level, you may get confused.22. Understand algorithms and data structures, and use appropriate data structures and algorithms when coding (if necessary)23. Test your code before delivering it24. If there are frequent delays, it may be that the tasks are not broken down into small enough pieces25. Take a small note after solving a coding problem. A good memory is not as good as a bad pen.26. Never copy code from the Internet, understand it first and then write it yourself27.Try to take the initiative to advance the project progress. This is a good way for you to stand out quickly.28. Take the initiative to fix bugs, no matter if they are yours or not. Of course, if they are not yours, make sure to let your boss know after you fix them.29. Log should be as standardized as possible, such as writing time and classification, and being able to redirect output30. Read more official documents. They are truly authoritative and full of details. After reading them, many problems will naturally disappear.31. Learn more English, whether it is Google or stackoverflow, or various official documents, fluent English reading, and habitual English search can help you surpass 90% of programmers32. After coding for an hour, you must stand up and walk a few steps to move your neck, otherwise you will need a book soon: " Cervical Spondylosis Rehabilitation Guide "
